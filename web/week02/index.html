		<p> Hello I am Denis Garley I am attending Rexburg for Computer Scienece,
			it is something that I have a passion for doing and so I decided to do this.
			I like to code and make fun programs. Checkout some of my fun ideas on scratch.
			I have been coding since I was in elementary ever since it has been a passion.
			The idea of being able to get the computer and write specific commands to a computer,
			that can then be executed is cool concept for me. My passion is learning. My goal in 
			this class is to learn how to make websites that can run on a server.
