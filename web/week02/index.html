				<p class="main01"> Hello I am Denis Garley I am attending Rexburg for Computer Scienece,
					it is something that I have a passion for doing and so I decided to do this.
					I like to code and make fun programs. Checkout some of my fun ideas on scratch.
					I have been coding since I was in elementary ever since it has been a passion.
					The idea of being able to get the computer and write specific commands to a computer,
					that can then be executed is cool concept for me. My passion is learning. My goal in 
					this class is to learn how to make websites that can run on a server. 
				</p>

				<p class="main01"> I am not the best at making websites I do try to make sure my website,
					looks neat for anyone that wants to view it. Many times I think about
					random things to add to this site. Other times I can't think of anything.
					So I made my website look like this.
